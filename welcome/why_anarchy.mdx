## Why use our LLM-VM?
- **Speed up development** - With AnarchyAI, one interface is all you need to interact with the latest LLMs available.

- **Lower costs** - Running models locally can reduce the pay-as-you-go costs of development and testing.

- **Flexibility** - AnarchyAI allows you to rapidly switch between popular models so you can pinpoint the exact right tool for your project.

- **Community** - Join our active community of highly motivated developers and engineers working passionately to democratize AGI

- **WYSIWYG** - Open source means nothing is hidden; we strive for transparency and efficiency so you can focus on building.

## Bounty
Some tickets we'll pay you for closing! Look at the ticket labels to see how much the bounty is. Note we can't guarantee that if you close a ticket we can pay you (only if you are from a non-US sanctioned country), and it is up to you to reach out and provide bank details.

## Our promises
**We will move towards open-source, not away from it.**

**We will work to accelerate the commoditization of AI.**

**We will not judge your use-cases (provided it is legal).**
