We're on a mission to democratize AI at whatever the cost. We believe that technology is defined by the people who use it, and aim to put those people in control by building transparent OSS solutions to challenges working with modern AI models.

## 🥹 Our promises 🥹

* We will move towards open-source, not away from it.
* We will work to accelerate the commoditization of AI.
* We will not judge your use-cases (provided it is legal).

## 💸 How will we make money? 💸

We are working to provide managed model hosting and training infrastructure for both developers and enterprises.
